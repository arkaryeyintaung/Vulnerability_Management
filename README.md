# Vulnerability_Management

### What is vulnerability management?

- Vulnerability Management means finding, checking, fixing, & sharing info about security problems in systems & software. This helps to keep everything safe from attacks.
- You have to scan for these issues often. After that, it’s important to look at risky they are. You might prioritize the really bad ones first and then look into applying fixes or workarounds.
- When done right, managing vulnerabilities helps protect an organization values its assets & data. Also, it keeps them in line with rules, making their overall cybersecurity much better. So, staying on top of this process is super important!

Vulnerability management is a continuous cycle that involves several key stages:
 - Detection
   - The involvement of laptops in testing for vulnerabilities through scan with tools and testing done 
manually. The process of automated scanning across the network is carried out through NLAs on the 
systems while the manual testing is done by a process commonly known as penetration testing.

 - Assessment
   - Identifying further threats, risks, and chances or chances and possibilities of them using several 
vulnerability rating methods. As a guide this should include Technical, Architectural and Business 
view. It is therefore advisable to involve an analyst or a person well conversant with the IT 
environment and the importance of business continuity to head this process.

 - Prioritization
   - The following aspects need to be mentioned: First, give priority to the elimination of defects that have 
been classified as “Critical” and “High” in terms of risk assessment. Go down from High priority based
on available resources (time, people, money) to supposed problems with threat level and impact 
potential of “Moderately High,” followed by “Moderately Low,” and “Low”.

 - Remediation
   - Remediation means the evaluation and ranking of risks to see which ones are more critical and need to 
be fixed. This can cover patching, security control, revoking or reinstalling compromised part, and 
deployment of workarounds. Risk management is concerned with the reduction of risks to an 
acceptable level while preserving the organizational functionality. Frequency carries the test and audit 
to guarantee long-term protection from new threats.

 - Verification
   - Confirmation of the decrease and supremacy of the threats that were previously associated with the 
weaknesses. This has to be done usually during the next automated scan and this is way of disarming a 
false sense of security. If the card was previously tested manually in the beginning, there should be an 
additional manual test in the end.

 - Documentation
   - Maintaining logs of vulnerabilities and the corresponding remedial measures with respect to 
compliance and auditing.


### Why important vulnerability management in organization?
Managing vulnerabilities is important for organizations. It helps guard against cyberattacks by finding 
and fixing security issues before they can be exploited. Here are some key reasons why it matters:
- Reducing Cyberattack Risks: This of an attacker getting in go way down when you so often 
to find and correct flaws. This protects identities, ideas, and essential programs and networks.

- Staying Compliant: There are such rules as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS, which state that 
organizations must have a vulnerability management process. If not, they are subjected to hefty 
penalties and possible legal ramifications.

- Protecting Reputation: This I found concerning: ‘A cyberattack or data breach can really 
damage an organization’s reputation.’ One of many threats associated with customer relations is 
that customers may cease to trust a company and, consequently, cease to do business with it. By 
addressing risks systematically, it becomes easier to address and prevent these issues from 
occurring.

- Saving Money: The errors need to be spotted on time in order to rectify them before they can 
cost so much. Security breach incidents are usually accompanied by expenses like rectification, 
legal services, and fines.

- Improving Security Posture: A good practice of vulnerability management ensures that 
security steps are kept up-to-date. This makes organizations respond effectively to new threats 
and remain formidable against attackers.

- Enabling Business Continuity: The prevention of exposure to vulnerability implies reduced 
disruption to systems. And this way, all the processes remain uninterrupted and are protected 
from cyber threats.

By managing vulnerabilities ahead of time, organizations can boost their overall cybersecurity, reduce 
risks, and keep trust while following rules in an ever-changing threat world.

### Vulnerability Scanner Tools (Tenable Nessus)

Tenable Nessus is widely popular as a used vulnerability scanner among many organizations that seek 
to identify security weaknesses in their IT environments, including networks and applications, while 
also detecting issues concerning missing patches, misconfigurations, and compliance nonconformities. 
Tenable Nessus: An Overview of its Functionality 
• Nessus performs scans through sending out probes to the network devices and systems as well 
as applications to identify vulnerabilities, including the available ports and services. The 
credentialed scans for more rigorous examination are also done.
• With integration, detection entails the use of scripts that are developed to analyze areas of risk 
or concern that are updated frequently for newer risks.
• After the process is done by Nessus, it generates detailed reports that help put the vulnerabilities
in a certain category of severity to be used in ranking the issues for priorities. 
Nessus is quite popular for its scan types and interface, together with updates for vulnerability 
assessment and control.
