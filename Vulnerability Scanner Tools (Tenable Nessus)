3. Vulnerability Scanner Tools (Tenable Nessus)
Tenable Nessus is widely popular as a used vulnerability scanner among many organizations that seek 
to identify security weaknesses in their IT environments, including networks and applications, while 
also detecting issues concerning missing patches, misconfigurations, and compliance nonconformities. 
Tenable Nessus: An Overview of its Functionality 
• Nessus performs scans through sending out probes to the network devices and systems as well 
as applications to identify vulnerabilities, including the available ports and services. The 
credentialed scans for more rigorous examination are also done.
• With integration, detection entails the use of scripts that are developed to analyze areas of risk 
or concern that are updated frequently for newer risks.
• After the process is done by Nessus, it generates detailed reports that help put the vulnerabilities
in a certain category of severity to be used in ranking the issues for priorities. 
Nessus is quite popular for its scan types and interface, together with updates for vulnerability 
assessment and control
